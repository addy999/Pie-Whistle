# Summary

For the loudest results, print the whistle on its side.
The Echo whistle started as an idea to create the loudest whistle for a 3D Printer and create a more compact survival whistle. This whistle is designed for the person who wants a easy, compact and loud whistle for any situation, ranging from survival to referees. 

Testing this print i used 3 different filament types, Wood, PLA, ABS all working perfectly. ABS being the strongest survived any tests i ran it though, throwing it down on the ground, running it over and water. With wood filament it was a bit  more brittle but still survived all the tests besides being ran over. The last of them being PLA which survived all tests with a minor amount of damage.

Below in the downloads are 2 different sizes for you to chose from, one with a lower tone and a higher tone.

For the loudest effect, i suggest you cover your ears as i did in the video and blow as hard as you can. Even though the whistle will work with less force than that.

I hope you enjoy this print as much as i did!

# Print Settings

Printer: FlashForge Dreamer
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: Any layer height
Infill: 15% - 25% you can print higher it may make it feel sturdier but with my experience it doesnt make that much of a difference

Notes: 
You can print this without a raft fine if you have a heated bed. If your printer does not have a heated bed a raft is recommended 

# Video Example

## Make sure to turn your volume down
