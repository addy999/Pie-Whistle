# Summary

This is a modified version of the MakeItLoud V29 Whistle that puts out 118+db.

I made the design a lot thinner and a little smaller so it can be more portable.
I also added a second hole that works very well on a smaller keychain.

The original design didn't sound very well if you did not blow very hard, but this one works pretty well even if you blow more slowly and less loud, but it still gets REALLY loud if you blow hard.

I really liked the original whistle, but this saves me time, plastic, and space!

# Print Settings

Printer:  Monoprice Maker Select (Prusa i3)
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 20%

# How I Designed This

I used MeshMixer by Autodesk to Modify the original STL file. I didn't know this at the time, but it generated a ridiculously large file. It has A LOT of polygons.

I went back to try to remove as many as I could, but the Reduce function didn't really do much, so I manually remeshed the areas and was able to reduce the size an extra 30%. 

Tips to fix it are welcome  in the comments!

<b>UPDATE</b>

Thanks to the remix by [curious_pl](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1324144) I found out about Blender, so I used it to bring down the mesh even further to around 600kB.
Sorry for the big file troubles, I'm still learning!

Also, at the request of [jzisa](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1179160), I made a video comparing the loudness of the original V29 vs this version with a crude iPhone decibel meter
